### I'm going to solve some convex optimization problems in this repository as I'm going through my learning path of this topic.

# Optimization
Optimization problems are ubiquitous in statistics and machine learning. A huge number of problems that we consider in these disciplines can indeed be posed as optimization tasks.

Studying the details is important for two  major  reasons:  
<li> Different algorithms can perform (sometimes drastically) better or worse in different scenarios, and an understanding of why this happens requires an understanding  of optimization 
<li> Often times, understanding a problem from the optimization perspective can contribute to our statistical understanding of the problem as well.
 
  
Half of the Machine Learning field is the construction of the learning method **(optimization)**, there're many techniqques used for optimization  if the optimization problem is solvable:
  - Closed form solution ==> Least Mean squares
  - Numerically and guaranteed ==> Conex optimization & Linear Programming
  - Numerically but not guaranteed ==> Non-Convex, and can be solved using many techniques:
    - Numerical algorithms like Gradient descent
    - Local optimization
    - Heuristic swarm-based methods
    - Brute force exhaustive search
