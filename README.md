# Optimization 
Optimization problems are ubiquitous in statistics and machine learning. A huge number of problems that we consider in these disciplines can indeed be posed as optimization tasks.

Studying the details is important for two  major  reasons:  
<li> Different algorithms can perform (sometimes drastically) better or worse in different scenarios, and an understanding of why this happens requires an understanding  of optimization
<li> Often times, understanding a problem from the optimization perspective can contribute to our statistical understanding of the problem as well.
  
### I'm going to solve some convex optimization problems in this repository as I'm going through my studies for this topic.
